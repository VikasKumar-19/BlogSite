Earlier, I have shared the best courses to learn React.js and the best React Books for beginners, and In this article, I am going to share some of the best online training courses to learn Next.js from scratch. If you don’t know, Next.js is a popular React framework that helps in server-side rendering which can significantly improve the user experience of page load ties. Using Server-side rendering also gives you an edge on SEO with a more easily indexable and crawlable website out of the box. Next.js is touted as the next big thing in the web development world and 2022 may be a good time to learn Next.js. In this article, I have shared online courses from Udemy, Educative, and Pluralsight that will teach you Next.js with React.js, even if you have no background on React as well as some advanced courses for developers who are already familiar with React and just want to learn Next.js. These are taught by some of the great instructors like Maximilliar Mular of Academind, and Brad Traversy, two of my favorite instructors for learning front-end technologies like React, Angular, Vue.js, and even basics like JavaScript and CSS. I have also chosen hands-on and project-based courses, I mean the courses which will not only teach you the theory and explain the concept but also show you how to apply them in the real world while building non-trivial projects. I have personally found project-based learning as the best way to learn any new technology, as you learn more when you use the thing. It’s ok to get information by reading, or watching but unless you put that into practice, you won’t actually learn and that’s where project-based and hands-on courses excel. They ensure that you build projects along with them and apply all the conepts you have learned to move ahead in your Next.js journey. Next.js also aims to solve the first-page download problem associated with Single page applications. Single-page apps or SPAs have become the standard and best way to build interactive websites in the modern world. Unfortunately, there’s a problem with most SPAs, and it’s called the first-page download problem, which leads to lots of waiting time. Since loading time is critical and almost 90% of web users leave if your site doesn’t load in 10 seconds it makes sense to learn more about this problem and solve it. Next.js can also be used as a static site generator and that’s why learning Next.js can be really great thing for web developers. 8 Best Online Courses to Learn Next.js in 2022 Without wasting any more of your time, here is a list of the best online courses to learn Next.js in 2022. Most of these courses will also teach you React as Next allows you to create better React applications but still knowing React basics will help you.
